# 100 days of node

This repository is meant to be my personal space to follow the #100daysOfCode challenge, but focused exclusively on nodeJS.
I hope that by the end of the challenge I'll be able to recognize myself as an advanced JavaScript/NodeJS developer. I'll be able to make new projects without getting stuck on any advanced topics.

## Some important notices for future Geraldo

1. No need to blame yourself if you've lost 1 or 2 consecutive days because you were spending some time with your family. Remember: you are not a robot;

2. Don't use the first message as an excuse for procrastination;

3. This challenge will help you become not only a better programmer and a nodeJS expert, but also a better person and professional. This will keep your consistency and persistance skills at their maximum.

4. Try to focus on the fundamentals. That means you should probably let frameworks for later and focus on the language.

5. Try to explain what you're doing in the code using comments. I know, I know, having comments everywhere is not "clean", but this is just for training purposes. Describing out of your head will help you internalize things.

6. Always use English.

## Day 01 - Iterators and Generators

I want to start the first day by studying something that I've been running from for some time. This simple `*` on functions gave me so much confusion back in the past, but I think I'm mature enough in the language today that I shouldn't have any problem understanding this concept.
