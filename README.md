# 100 days of node

This repository is meant to be my personal space to follow the #100daysOfCode challenge, but focused exclusively on nodeJS.
I hope that by the end of the challenge I'll be able to recognize myself as an advanced JavaScript/NodeJS developer. I'll be able to make new projects without getting stuck on any advanced topics.
